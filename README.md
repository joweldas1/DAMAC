# DAMAC

This frontend project is built using React. Below is an overview of the setup and procedures followed during development.

## Setup

1. **React Router DOM**: Installed to facilitate the creation of additional routes as needed.
2. **CSS Framework**: Primarily used Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap for efficiency, though vanilla CSS was occasionally employed.
3. **React Icons**: Utilized for incorporating icons throughout the project.
4. **React Hot Toast**: Used to confirm successful button clicks with notifications.
5. **React Swiper JS**: Implemented for creating sliders.
6. **AOS (Animate On Scroll)**: Used for adding scroll animations.
7. **Firebase**: Used to create a live link.
8. **Node Package Manager (NPM)**: Used for local host preview with `npm run dev`.

## Project Structure

This is a single-page application with only the Home route available. The project is designed to be expandable.

- **Home Component**: The main component where all sections of the homepage are included.
- **Components Folder**: Contains shared components used across the homepage.

This task was very interesting and engaging.
